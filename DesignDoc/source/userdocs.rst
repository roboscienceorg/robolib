User Documentation
==================

There are two main types of users for our project: contributors and people who use the library.

For the contributors, we have a contribution guide and code of conduct on our repository [here](https://github.com/roboscienceorg/robolib/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [here](https://github.com/roboscienceorg/robolib/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), respectively.

The API documentation will be generated with Python Sphinx and maintained on the RoboScience website with tutorials 
for each module. This will appear as soon as the RoboScience website is complete. Upon completion, this document 
will be updated to link to the documentation.
