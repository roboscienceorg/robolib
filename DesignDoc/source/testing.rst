System and Unit Testing Design
==============================

This section describes the approach taken with regard to system and unit
testing. This chapter does not describe the outcome of those tests. That
will be described in the prototypes chapter.

Overview
--------

Provides a brief overview of the testing approach, testing frameworks,
and general how testing is/will be done to provide a measure of success
for the system.

Each requirement (user story component) should be tested. A review of
objectives and constraints might be needed here.

Dependencies
------------

Describe the basic dependencies which should include unit testing
frameworks and reference material.

Test design and setup
---------------------

Describe how test cases were developed/designed, setup, and how they
connect to the requirements. This section can be extremely involved if a
complete list of test cases was warranted for the system. One approach
is to list each requirement, module, or component and describe the test.

The unit test framework is described here.
