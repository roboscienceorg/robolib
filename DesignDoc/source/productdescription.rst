Software Agreement
==================

The software contract for this project is found in the repository under the 
"DesignDoc/" folder.

Product Description
===================

The product developed by this library is two-fold: a library for use with an
introductory-level robotics course and a thorough set of tutorials which not
only explain the use of the library but also link to the relevant sections of the
online book found at http://www.roboscience.org/.

The Library
-----------

The library consists of independent modules (described in detail in the Backlog section).
These modules correspond to chapters within the book and serve to provide an
easy-to-use codebase to assist with understanding robotics topics. Each module
will contain an object or set of objects which can be interacted with to demonstrate
a concept from the book.

For example, the Differential Drive Robot module contains a DDR object which allows
the user to apply forward and inverse kinematics to a robot with specific wheels and
axel length. This can be utilized by a student to collect simulation data for
visualization purposes or to assist with more complex motion algorithm development.


The Tutorials
-------------

While all software should come with manuals providing a description of how to 
use the product, this project, specifically, has an increased focus on user-focused
documentation as the purpose of this project is educational.

The library should assist the student with hurdling common obstacles in robotics
problems but misses the philosophical mark if it does so without providing 
ample effort to educate the user on the underlying processes.
