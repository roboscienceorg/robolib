Business Plan
=============

This business plan details the strategy to build an open-source platform around
both the RoboScience Organization as well as the RoboLib library specifically. 

Business Model
--------------

**Customer Segment:** Within the robotics community, there is a vast spectrum of 
experience level which can easily divide the field into sub-segments. This business
plan will view the community in a single-divide taxonomy: people looking to learn the
fundamentals of robotics, and those who feel comfortable with the basics. This is a 
crude division, but it allows the plan to address meeting the needs of both groups.

For the people who are looking to learn robotics fundamentals, their end goal is fairly
simple: they wish to be educated in robotics. This includes not only traditional educational
methods such as books and lectures, but also experiential learning methods where they
may get their hands on code.


For the people already educated in robotics fundamentals, their goal would be to connect with
like-minded people in the robotics field as well as gain further experience with robotics 
topics.


**Value Proposition:** The value proposition of this project includes the methods to address
the above user goals. These value propositions will interact with the users via Channels and
Relationships (discussed below).

For the users desiring further education, the RoboScience community was founded to address
these problems. The community's end goal is to facilitate learning. This is accomplished through
two main avenues: the open-source textbook and the RoboLib library. As the two methods develop
together, they will provide a cohesive learning environment with the book discussing robotics theory,
and the library enabling these users to experiment with these topics in a Python environment.

For the users already educated in robotics, the RoboLib project provides value for them by
establishing an avenue to further develop this education in the form of open-source contribution.
Provided the community continues to grow, it also allows robotics contributors to meet people
from various sides of the robotics industry/academia, allowing for idea collaboration. This
contribution would be a more introductory step into open-source then, say, the Open Source
Robotics Foundation (which is a community responsible for products such as the Robot
Operating System and Gazebo Simulator).


**Channels:** The users will interact with these constructs via two main methods. 

The first is the Roboscience website (www.roboscience.org). This portal establishes the location of
the text book and a landing point for community development. Currently the community aspect
is in-the-works, but users looking for education have access to the newest version of the text.

The other main channel is the RoboLib Github page (https://github.com/roboscienceorg/robolib).
This is the landing page for both types of users as it contains tutorials for users looking to 
utilize the library to supplement the textbook, as well as a framework for users looking to
contribute. Discussions on the Github forum or bug reports will also provide methods for users
to interact with the project managers and other users regarding new/revised structures for
the project.


**Customer Relationships:** Customer relationships will be fostered in two directions: with the 
project leads and with each other.

The relationship between the users and the project leads is a vital one in the open-source community.
Ideally, this relationship should happen on a daily basis. This interation will occur in a number of
ways, for instance when a user finds a bug in previously written software. The project flow would
dictate that the user submit a bug request to be reviewed and addressed by project leads. The
actual fix for an issue may be a culmination of both project lead and user software development 
efforts. Another example of this relationship would be the submission of a feature to the library.
Ideally, the user will have contacted a project lead to discuss the addition prior to writing any
code, but project leads supporting a user's efforts to contribute is the mark of a truly successful
open-source community.

The other type of relationship is between the users. Unlike traditional software, an open-source 
project allows for strong collaboration between the users of the project as they will likely have
a stronger hand on the direction the project goes. Ensuring that users have easy facilities to 
communicate with other users is important, as well as that Codes of Conduct are followed. These
relationships can be the hardest to grow, but the power of user collaboration is what drives open-
source projects to greatness.


**Revenue Streams:** As this is an open-source project, there is no expected revenue streams. The only
potential revenue currently projected would be grants to support the development of this project. There
will not be a cost associated with this project to the end users.

Donations may eventually be encouraged to cover the costs attributed with the project. See *Cost Structure*
below.


**Key Resources:** During the development of this project, some key resources are as follows:

* Robotics Theoretical Knowledge (from the RoboScience book)
* Client/Maintainer Input and Connection to Robotics Academia
* GitHub's framework for open-source projects (https://opensource.guide/)
* Successful scientific open-source projects (Numpy, etc.)

These resources will be utilized during the development of the library to ensure that processes are in
place for contributors. They will also guide the development in terms of direction.


**Key Partners:** The main partner on this project is Dr. Jeff McGough, who is the founder of the RoboScience
organization. He will remain the permanent maintainer of the project and will be responsible for setting the
high-level direction of the organization.

Other important partners will include the senior design teams who contribute as well as any
educators orstudents of robotics who wish to contribute.

**Cost Structure:** Due to the open-source nature of the project, the cost structure should be minimal. 
There are reasonable small costs associated with items such as hosting a website, etc. These will initially
be covered by the maintainer of the project, but hopefully future grants or donations could cover these costs.



Market and Competition
----------------------

The beauty of building a project focused on education means that "competition" is both a good and a
bad concept. The good aspect is that people are working to provide students in this field a means
of learning. However, if the areas of focus for multiple projects overlap significantly, it is easy
for there to be educational overload for the user, ultimately driving them away from the subject.

The goal of this project is to fill a niche not currently met by robotics education. This niche is
beginner robotics for people educated in the STEM area. Often, robotics education falls into two
categories: beginner education for people without a strong mathematical and scientific background,
and highly specific education for people who have learned the fundamentals in the classroom. 

Roboscience was designed to address this by providing an approachable introduction to robotics for 
someone with a strong math background. Importantly, this requirement does not require immense
experience with programming. The theory behind robotics algorithms are platform independent, so
the only requirement is a math background. Certain topics may require small research of related 
topics, but not necessarily formal schooling.

From this desire came the goal of designing a Python library to work in conjunction with the 
book as an experiential tool. Python was selected because of its use within the robotics
community, and its role as an easy language to teach the basics of. This library would 
provide objects that the user could play with and experiment with to learn the topics provided
in the book.

As far as market research has shown, there are no organizations which provide this same type of
structure, but it can be hard to get an accurate survey of the field. Ultimately, if a direct
competitor were to be found, perhaps the projects could find a way to either differentiate or 
merge. The end goal is to provide an easy-to-access learning environment.


Regulatory environment
----------------------

As an open-source project, there is not much regulation in the environment in terms of user protection. 
However, if this were to formally be attached to a class taught by a University, it would be
important to ensure no unmet regulations are inherited from the academic world.

That being said, any user of the project must abide by the agreement described by our license, 
the Educational Community Licence V2.0. In general terms, this license allows for the free use
and redistribution of the project, provided that any modified and redistributed code includes the
license as well as a notice of modifications. This license also exonerates any of the contributors
from losses or damages caused by the use of the project. 

Although there are few formal regulations in the open-source environment, there is also a moral
responsibility to ensure that the education provided is factually accurate, as this could
potentially inform future robotics professionals.


Intellectual Property and Freedom to Operate
--------------------------------------------

As this is an open-source project, the intellectual property remains open-source. However,
distribution of the source code is subject to the Educational Community License Version 2.0
(https://opensource.org/licenses/ECL-2.0).


Management Team and Advisors
----------------------------

The maintainer of this project is Dr. Jeff McGough. The current management team includes the
Senior Design team as well as current robotics students. This management will change as
contributors change, so Dr. McGough will remain the maintainer of the project.


Sources and Uses of Capital
---------------------------

As previously stated, there is very little capital involved in this project simply due to
its open-source nature. Items such as the RoboScience website will remain with client,
Dr. McGough, as he is currently responsible for the payment and maintenance of the site.



Metrics and Milestones
----------------------

While not currently established, the future of the RoboScience community will depend on
contributors beyond SD Mines' campus. Therefore, future development of this project should
focus on establishing goals for external contributors.

Some useful metrics for this project would be the following:

* Active contributors
* Hits on the RoboScience website
* Fork/Clone numbers of the RoboLib
* Number of bug reports/requests for features

Exit Plan
---------

One of the long-term goals is to foster a self-sufficient community of contributors that will
keep this project maintained. That being said, the current development team has decided with our
client that we will not continue as the maintainers of the project post-graduation. In an effort
to ensure there is a sufficient technical hand-off to those who follow, we will create a Maintainer's
Guide to supplement the Contributor's Guide. The purpose of this document would be to impart the
philosophy behind our various contribution strategies and provide checklists of items that need
to be completed for common tasks such as pushing a new release out or fixing a bug.

Beyond these process items, the transition guide will contain all the required usernames and passwords
to access 3rd party applications such as our Continuous Integration framework, Travis CI.

We will be sure to include our contact information in case there are items which we forget to add in
the Maintainer's Guide.
