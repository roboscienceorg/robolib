Sprint Results and Prototypes
=============================

This chapter is for recording the results of each sprint and documenting
the evolving product. It is a historical record of what you accomplished
in 464/465. This should be organized according to Sprints. It should
have the basic description of the sprint deliverable and what was
accomplished. Screen shots, photos, captures from video, etc should be
used. Expect this to be a long chapter.
