User Stories, Requirements, and Product Backlog
===============================================

Overview
--------

The overview should take the form of an executive summary. Give the
reader a feel for the purpose of the document, what is contained in the
document, and an idea of the purpose for the system or product.

The user stories are provided by the stakeholders. You will create he
backlogs and the requirements, and document here. This chapter should
contain details about each of the requirements and how the requirements
are or will be satisfied in the design and implementation of the system.

Below: list, describe, and define the requirements in this chapter.
There could be any number of sub-sections to help provide the necessary
level of detail.

User Stories
------------

This section can really be seen as the guts of the document. This
section should be the result of discussions with the stakeholders with
regard to the actual functional requirements of the software. It is the
user stories that will be used in the work breakdown structure to build
tasks to fill the product backlog for implementation through the
sprints.

This section should contain sub-sections to define and potentially
provide a breakdown of larger user stories into smaller user stories.
Each component must have a test identified, meaning you need to know how
you plan to test it. If a requirement is not testable, then some
justification needs to be made on why the requirement has been included.
The results of the tests should go in the testing chapter.

User Story #1

User story #1 discussed.

User Story #1 Breakdown
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Does the first user story need some division into smaller, consumable
parts by the reader? This does not need to go to the level of actual
task definition and may not be required.

User Story #2

User Story #2 Breakdown

Requirements and Design Constraints
-----------------------------------

Use this section to discuss what requirements exist that deal with
meeting the business need. These requirements might equate to design
constraints which can take the form of system, network, and/or user
constraints. Examples: Windows Server only, iOS only, slow network
constraints, or no offline, local storage capabilities.

System Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What are they? How will they impact the potential design? Are there
alternatives?

Network Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What are they?

Development Environment Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What are they? Is the system supposed to be cross-platform?

Project Management Methodology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The stakeholders might restrict how the project implementation will be
managed. There may be constraints on when design meetings will take
place. There might be restrictions on how often progress reports need to
be provided and to whom.

Specifications
--------------

Any specifications that need to be understood? Put it here.

Product Backlog
---------------

The full initial product backlog should go here. The sprint backlogs are
located in the prototypes chapter.

-  What system will be used to keep track of the backlogs and sprint
   status?

-  Will all parties have access to the Sprint and Product Backlogs?

-  How many Sprints will encompass this particular project?

-  How long are the Sprint Cycles?

-  Are there restrictions on source control?

Research or Proof of Concept Results
------------------------------------

This section is reserved for the discussion centered on any research
that needed to take place before full system design. The research
efforts may have led to the need to actually provide a proof of concept
for approval by the stakeholders. The proof of concept might even go to
the extent of a user interface design or mockups.

Supporting Material
-------------------

This document might contain references or supporting material which
should be documented and discussed either here if appropriate or more
often in the appendices at the end. This material may have been provided
by the stakeholders or it may be material garnered from research tasks.
